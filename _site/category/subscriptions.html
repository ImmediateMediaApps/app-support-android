          <h3>Will I be charged twice if I delete or lose an issue and re-install it?</h3>
          <p>No. Any previous purchases you have made will be recorded in your purchase history so we will know that you have already bought the issue and therefore you will never be charged twice for the same issue. The App itself is free to download.</p>

          <p>If you’re not happy with one of our products we would really like to know about it. Please contact us using the Support form (instructions at the top of this page), we will try to either fix the problem or provide you with a satisfactory replacement.
