If you are confident that you have a good connection and links still don’t seem to work, try deleting/archiving the issue and downloading it again. If you are confident that you have a good connection and the issue still won’t download please report the problem (instructions at the top of this page).</p>

          <h3>My issue isn't downloading or is not responding, what can I do?</h3>
          <p>First of all make sure you have a stable internet connection over wifi, 3G or 4G (additional data charges may apply, please use wifi where possible). You can archive your issue and download it again. To archive your issue please see the FAQ “How do I delete or archive an issue I’ve downloaded?”.</p>

<p>If your issue still doesn’t work correctly you can try deleting the App from your device and installing it again. Although this may sound extreme it is often necessary, it can solve problems that otherwise seem to have no logical explanation. You won’t lose any of your purchases but you will need to download issues again.</p>

          <h3>Is the app no longer viewable in landscape?</h3>
          <p>Most of our app “storefronts” are fixed to portrait, but any content that you download to read can still be viewed in either portrait or landscape.</p>
