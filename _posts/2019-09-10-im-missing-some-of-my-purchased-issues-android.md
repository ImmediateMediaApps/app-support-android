Any previous purchases you have made will be tied your Google Account. You can restore your previous purchases at any time.

On app versions 6.0.4 or higher all you need to do is pull down and trigger the app to refresh. Closing the app and opening it again should also check your purchases are updated. If you are missing issues after trying these things, please contact us.
