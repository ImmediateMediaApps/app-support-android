Unfortunately, at this time we cannot transfer purchases made via iTunes to a Google Play (Android) account. This is because of the different systems that Apple and Google use to handle their purchases. This is out of our control but we are always looking for ways to improve this experience for our customers.

However, if you purchased a Digital subscription or Bundle from buysubscriptions.com you can access your subscription on either Android or Apple devices.
