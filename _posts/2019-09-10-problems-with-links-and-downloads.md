Double check you have an active internet connection on either Wi-Fi or 3G (data charges may apply). If you are confident that you have a good connection and links still don't seem to work, try deleting/archiving the issue and downloading it again. If you are confident that you have a good connection and the issue still won't download please report the problem (instructions at the top of this page).
