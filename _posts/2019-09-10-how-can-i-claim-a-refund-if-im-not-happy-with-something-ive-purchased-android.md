If you are not satisfied with the app or with content in the app, please contact support and we will do our best to resolve the problems.

If you buy a magazine issue via Google Play (In App Purchase) and you arenâ€™t happy with it for any reason, you can return it within two hours for a full refund. After that two hour period is up, though, you have a 48-hour window during which a refund request can be processed by Google.

However, if you are unable to get a refund via Google Play, you can still contact Support and we may be able to refund you. Your statutory rights are not affected.
